Implementing Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

Writing the code in real time and going over the concepts like each time complexity/memory complexity of each data structure's operariton and algorithm on my youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/vert3737).

Each Data Structure and Algorithm Folder should have a powerpoint giving a general overview about the topic, the code for that topic and accompanying unit tests (all of them should be passing).

Doing this to help myself/as well as other study for technical interviews. I don't think there are tha many great resources out there in this area that are free, easy to follow, in Python, conducted by a fluent English speaker, and under 20 minutes each.

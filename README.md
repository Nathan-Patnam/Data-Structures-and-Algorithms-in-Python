Implementing data structures and algorithms in Python

Writing the code in real time and going over the concepts like each time complexity/memory complexity of each data structure's operariton and algorithm on my youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/vert3737)

Each Data Structure and Algorithm Folder should have a powerpoint giving a general overview about the topic, the code for that topic and accompanying unit tests (all of them should be passing)
